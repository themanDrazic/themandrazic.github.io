## I. Summary
In this lab, the goal was to start up the RedBoard Artemis Nano with the Arduino IDE to ensure that some of the peripherals were working. I wrote very little code in this lab as the majority of the scripts we ran were from the provided SparkFun examples!

## II. Blinks Example
In this section, we used the example Arduino "Blink It Up" script to flash the LED on and off at a rate of 1 second. Check out the video below to watch it in action!
